abstract: The problem of identifying the degree of semantic similarity between
  two textual statements automatically has grown in importance in recent times.
  Its impact on various computer-related domains and recent breakthroughs in
  neural computation has increased the opportunities for better solutions to be
  developed. This research takes the research efforts a step further by
  designing and developing a novel neurofuzzy approach for semantic textual
  similarity that uses neural networks and fuzzy logics. The fundamental notion
  is to combine the remarkable capabilities of the current neural models for
  working with text with the possibilities that fuzzy logic provides for
  aggregating numerical information in a tailored manner. The results of our
  experiments suggest that this approach is capable of accurately determining
  semantic textual similarity.
